# Docker Networking

This is a write up of my docker networking demo at the Docker Orlando meetup.

Let's begin with the diagram.

![figure-1](img/docker-networking.png)

We can see in *figure 1* a server which can be a physical device or a vm(cloud or not)
connected to the Internet by an interface *ens3* as its gateway interface - *ens3* 
because kvm configures it by default.
Then we have four Linux bridges. One is *docker0* which is the default linux bridge
configured when Docker is set up. It has connection to the outside world, and it has 
inter-container communication enabled by default. Then we have two network segments managed by Docker 
which are *user-defined networks*. These bridges are also Linux bridges. One of these
bridges(*demo_internal*) is an internal network which means it doesn't have connection to the outside, and
the other one(*demo_net*) has connection to the outside world. Finally, there's 
*demo_ns* which is **only a network namespace** and NOT A VIRTUAL SERVER. This
segment has two virtual ethernet interfaces which their final end are connected 
to a Linux bridge *nsbr0*  and to the *server* respectively.


## Docker0

*docker0* is just a Linux bridge with no modifications whatsoever managed by the 
docker engine. It gives the subnet 172.17.0.0/16, so you can fire up plenty of containers 
to play with. An interesting observation is to see if the host's mac address table
 can map as much containers as the network segment valid hosts.
The *docker0* is part of the *docker default networks*. Docker supports three types
of networks: bridge(docker0), none, and host. 
- *Bridge* is just a Linux bridge where all the containers if no network is specified 
are allocated to it. The bridge network is customisable, but the docker daemon needs
to be restarted. Options of this bridge can be found in `docker network inspect bridge`.

| Options          | Values           |
| ---------------- | :--------------: |
| com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge | true or false |
| com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc | true or false |
| com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade | true or false |
| com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4 | ipv4 to bind |
| com.docker.network.bridge.name | bridge name |
| com.docker.network.driver.mtu | mtu |

- *None* disables network capabilities to containers; in other words, it's attached to itself.
- *Host* adds a container on the host’s network stack.

Let's configure the docker0 bridge. As we said previously, this is pretty much configured 
at installation time. But let's take a look to the network environment before doing it.

Iptables is accepting everything with no rules defined. Also, the routing table only 
shows the directly connected interface and the default gateway rule. Last, there's only
two interfaces.
Let's install docker.

First of all, Docker enables ip forwarding at the kernel level(`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`) 
to have  communication between internal and external hosts.In addition, it creates some 
firewall rules for docker isolation to `DROP` or `ACCEPT` communication between 
containers and other hosts throught the `FORWARD` chain.
It's better to check [this official explanation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/container-communication/) 
from the docker site about container communication.

Let's disable inter-container communication (`--icc=false`) and create some containers.


        $sudo systemctl stop docker
        $sudo dockerd --icc=false &

        $docker run -itd --name=c_in_bridge busybox
        $docker run -itd --name=c_in_internal busybox
        $docker run -itd --name=c_in_net busybox
        $docker run -itd --name=web_in_all httpd:2.4

        # Inspecting iptables and interfaces after docker is installed

Each time a container is run with a published port(`web_in_all`), docker inserts 
 a `POSTROUTING` rule to nat the pusblished ports from the host to the container. 
Also, notice that the rule to communicate between container has been changed from DROP to ACCEPT 
when docker is run with inter-container communication disabled. Furthermore, we see 
four new virtual interfaces, one for each container. Each interface is connected 
to the docker0 bridge in the global namepsace, and the other end is connected to
the container network namespace; however, `vethXXXXX` doesn't say anything of 
which interface belongs to which container on the host. Nonetheless, the following one liner can 
help you identifying the interface index, because each veth pair is created sequentially.

        $DOCKER_ID=`docker ps -aqf "name=web_in_all"`
        $docker inspect --format='{{.State.Pid}}' $(DOCKER_ID) | xargs -I '{}' sudo nsenter -t '{}' -n ethtool -S eth0

## User-defined Networks

> In this doc we are not explaining about docker swarm(vxlan) at all. Please
> refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/) 
> to learn more.

Docker provides something called user-defined networks which are Linux bridges with
DNS resolution without having to configure your own DNS server. It has several 
network drivers: bridge, overlay, macvlan; and supports network plugins to build
your own network driver. Also, It permits to connect several containers to 
different networks(including the docker0 network). As you can connect a container
to several networks, its external connectivity is provided via the first 
non-internal network, in lexical order.

> Docker has an option for linking containers in `docker0`, with user-defined 
> network I don't see a reason to keep using it. Also, linking is not supported
> in user-defined networks.


Now, let's create the docker networks.

        $docker network create -o "com.docker.network.kbridge.enable_icc=false" --internal demo_internal

        $docker network create demo_net

        $docker network ls

`br-22abcb2ef140` is the bridge for `demo_internal` in my environment. The bridge 
name follows the syntax `br-$(network-id)`. The network id can be obtained by 
`docker network ls` command or `docker network inspect [network-name]`. The same applies
for `demo_net` with its bridge `br-119bb8423775`.
We can see that two new networks has been created. Also, there's one new rule in 
the `FORWARD` chain, and there are two new rules in the `DOCKER-ISOLATION` chain. 
In addition, there's one rule added in the `POSTROUTING` chain and one in the `DOCKER`(PREROUTING) chain 
for `demo_net`. This mean that `demo_net` has NAT capabilities to communicate to the outside world
,but `demo_internal` has not. `DOCKER-ISOLATION` chain isolates completely 
the `demo_internal` network, but for `docker_net` means there's no communication to the docker0 bridge. In the
 FORWARD chain we see that both networks have accepted connections to communicate
 between containers. In the case of `demo_net` it also has communication to the 
outside world.

We can attach/dettach running containers to several networks. At this moment, both 
networks are down, because there's now device connected to the bridge.

        $ip link show
        13: br-22abcb2ef140: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default
            link/ether 02:42:0b:7a:5f:f6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        15: br-119bb8423775: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default
            link/ether 02:42:89:3b:e5:2e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

To connect the containers to the different networks use `docker network connect [network_name] [container]`.

        $docker network connect bridge web_in_all
        $docker network connect demo_internal web_in_all

Both bridges now are up after we connect containers to them. There are also 
two rules added to the routing table as directly connected.


## Network Namespaces

Provides isolation of the system resources associated with networking: network 
devices, IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks, IP routing tables, firewalls, 
the /proc/net directory, the /sys/class/net directory, port numbers (sockets), 
and so on. This means that each network namespace has its own networking stack.

It uses a virtual device(veth) pair to create a tunnel
for communication between namespaces. It always comes in pair, with one end in 
the root namespace and the other end in a namespace.

The device is created in whatever namespace is current in.  If a device does not
 belong to the current namespace, it becomes invisible.

In the case of docker containers, each container has their own network stack. 
The network namespace is located in /proc/$pid/ns/ for each process:

        $DOCKER_ID=`docker ps -aqf "name=web_in_all"`
        /proc/`docker inspect --format='{{.State.Pid}}' ${DOCKER_ID}`/ns/net

To configure a network namespace by hand we'll use the `ip` command.

        $ sudo ip netns add demo_ns

        $ sudo ip netns ls
        demo_ns

        $mount | grep demo_ns
        nsfs on /run/netns/demo_ns type nsfs (rw)
        nsfs on /run/netns/demo_ns type nsfs (rw)

We have created and listed a new namespace; however, `ip` mounts a a virtual 
filesystem named nsfs to keep `demo_ns` alive; otherwise, the namespace would have ended 
when `ip` command terminated executing without mounting the network namespace.

Let's create a veth pair device and send one of them to `demo_ns` 

        $ sudo ip link add v-eth0 type veth peer name v-peer0
        $ip link show
        18: v-peer0@v-eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 26:46:1c:69:75:42 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        19: v-eth0@v-peer0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether aa:92:de:a0:77:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

        $sudo ip link set v-peer0 netns demo_ns
        $ip link show
        19: v-eth0@if18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether aa:92:de:a0:77:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 4

Notice that only `v-eth0` remains in the global namespace.

        $ sudo ip addr add 10.100.0.1/24 dev v-eth0
        $ sudo ip link set v-eth0 up
        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ip addr add 10.100.0.2/24 dev v-peer0
        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ip link set v-peer0 up
        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ip link set lo up
        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ip addr show
        1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1
            link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

        18: v-peer0@if19: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 26:46:1c:69:75:42 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
            inet 10.100.2.0/24 scope global v-peer0
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 fe80::2446:1cff:fe69:7542/64 scope link
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        $ip addr show v-eth0
        19: v-eth0@if18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether aa:92:de:a0:77:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 4
            inet 10.100.0.1/24 scope global v-eth0

        $ ip route

        10.100.0.0/24 dev v-eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.100.0.1

`ip netns exec [net_ns]` permits executing commands inside a network namespace. 
In this case we have configure `v-eth0` in the global namespace and `v-peer0` inside
`demo_ns`. Also notice that the host creates a route for 10.100.0.0, because it's 
directed connected device. Iptables has no changes at all.

        $ ping 10.100.0.2 -c 2
        PING 10.100.0.2 (10.100.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from 10.100.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.094 ms
        64 bytes from 10.100.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.057 ms

        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ping 10.100.0.1 -c 2
        PING 10.100.0.1 (10.100.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from 10.100.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.057 ms
        64 bytes from 10.100.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.064 ms

We have verified there's connection inside the tunnel.


### Let's get weird

First of all, we are going to link `web_in_all` network namespace to `/var/run/netns`, 
so it can be managed by the `ip` command.

        $DOCKER_ID=`docker ps -aqf "name=web_in_all"`
        $sudo ln -s /proc/`docker inspect --format='{{.State.Pid}}' ${DOCKER_ID}`/ns/net /var/run/netns/${DOCKER_ID}
        $sudo ip netns ls
        270dca5b1f67 (id: 0)
        demo_ns (id: 4)


Then, we are going to install and configure a Linux bridge named `nsbr0`. This 
bridge will have two veth connected to it. One is a new veth pair which one end is
going to be in the `demo_ns` network namespace. The other veth pair will be a 
tunnel connected  to the `web_in_all` network namespace.

        $sudo apt install bridge-utils -y

        $sudo ip link add v-eth1 type veth peer name v-peer-1
        $sudo ip link add v-ethc type veth peer name v-peer-c

        $sudo brctl addbr nsbr0
        $ sudo brctl addif nsbr0 v-eth1
        $ sudo brctl addif nsbr0 v-ethc

        $ip link show
        20: nsbr0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 26:bc:6a:17:76:9a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        23: v-peer-1@v-eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 6a:56:f9:8a:22:c2 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        24: v-eth1@v-peer-1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop master nsbr0 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether b2:9f:3c:ba:0c:97 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        25: v-peer-c@v-ethc: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether a6:4c:ea:4e:f0:a1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        26: v-ethc@v-peer-c: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noop master nsbr0 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000

        $sudo ip link set v-peer-c netns ${DOCKER_ID}
        $sudo ip link set v-peer-1 netns demo_ns
        $sudo ip link set v-eth1 up
        $sudo ip link set v-ethc up
        $sudo ip link set nsbr0 up
        $sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ip link set v-peer-c up
        $sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ip addr add 10.200.0.3/24 dev v-peer-c
        $sudo ip addr add 10.200.0.1/24 dev nsbr0
        $sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ip addr add 10.200.0.2/24 dev v-peer-1
        $sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ip link set v-peer-1 up

After configuring our new bridge and veths devices. Let's explore how's the view 
in each network namespace:

        $ip link show 
        20: nsbr0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 26:bc:6a:17:76:9a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        24: v-eth1@if23: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master nsbr0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether b2:9f:3c:ba:0c:97 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 4
        26: v-ethc@if25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master nsbr0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether 26:bc:6a:17:76:9a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0

        $ ip route
        10.200.0.0/24 dev nsbr0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.200.0.1

Now we have `v-eth1` and `v-ethc` connected to `nsbr0`. and ip route shows a new route
for `10.200.0.1`.

        $ sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ip link show
        1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1

        25: v-peer-c@if26: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
            link/ether a6:4c:ea:4e:f0:a1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0

        $ sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ip route

        10.200.0.0/24 dev v-peer-c  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.200.0.3 linkdown

`web_in_all` has a new veth and a new route for 10.200.0.0.

        $sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.0.0/24 -o ens3 -j MASQUERADE

We added a rule in the `POSTROUTING` chain to map demo_ns connections to nsbr0 ip address. Then, 
a default route has been added to demo_ns to route connections to the outside world.
Nevertheless, *which dns resolver is using demo_ns?*. Remember that a network namespace
just gives a new IP stack. A dns resolver is not part of the network namespace. 
Well, when you execute `ip netns exec [net_ns]` you are still using the global
mount namespace, so the files you are using are the same as the root filesystem.
In other words, `/etc/resolv.conf` is the same for all the namespaces created with
the `ip netns` command. However, with `ip netns` you might use a different resolver 
creating a new file in /etc/netns/[netns_name]/resolv.conf for each network namespace.

        $ echo '127.0.0.1 mytest' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
        127.0.0.1 mytest
        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ping mytest -c 2
        PING mytest (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.070 ms
        64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.086 ms

As you can see, we hava added a new entry in `/etc/hosts`. Pinging from `demo_ns` 
resulted succesful for `mytest`.

        $sudo mkdir -p /etc/netns/demo_ns/
        $echo '127.0.0.1 myns' | sudo tee -a /etc/netns/demo_ns/hosts

        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ping myns -c 2
        PING myns (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from myns (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.072 ms
        64 bytes from myns (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.093 m

        $ sudo ip netns exec demo_ns ping mytest -c 2
        ping: unknown host mytest

If we add a new resolver for the `demo_ns` we notice that `mytest` is no longer 
reachable, but `myns` is. Just remember that `/etc/netns/[netns_name]/` only works
with the `ip netns` command.

What about giving web_in_all exit to the outside world by nsbr0.

        # Some output has been cut

        $sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ip route add  93.184.216.34/32 via 10.200.0.1

        $sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ping 93.184.216.34 -c 2

        64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=22.9 ms

        $sudo ip netns exec ${DOCKER_ID} ping example.com -c 2
        PING example.com (93.184.216.34) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=53.1 ms
        64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=2 ttl=52 time=26.5 ms

We added a static route for `example.com` and we verified that is using `nsbr0` 
as their gateway with `ip route get` command. 

which resolver is using `web_in_all`?  As it uses its own mount namespace, it uses
 the resolver configured by docker, but you can use a different resolver if you connect 
to the `web_in_all` network namespace using `ip netns` command and follow correct 
network configurations.

## Conclusion

- It's better to use user-defined networks to segment, organize and isolate containers.
- You still can find bugs in Docker, some of them can be confusing.
- Network namespace provides isolation for network resources.
- Network namespace is used not only by Docker, but is fundamental in kubernetes, 
openstack and many others.
